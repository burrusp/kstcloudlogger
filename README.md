# KSTCloudLogger

takes specific inputs and generates a JSON formatted log and prints the entry to the console/cloudwatch.

Pass into the log_entry command in the following order (context, "SourceProcessName","CorrelationID","LogSeverity","log_detail",Addition(OPTIONAL))

NOTE: context is a field auto-generated by Lambda when triggered. Just pass in as is.

NOTE: the Addition is an optional field that you can pass any json formated object that you want included in the log. For example:

```Python
custom = {"developer": "Burrus", "Last_updated": "now"}
logger(context,"Burrus","123","info","this is a test log",custom)
```
